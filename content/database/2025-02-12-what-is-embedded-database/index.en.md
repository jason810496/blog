The blog is talking about **Embedded Database**, not **Embedding Database ( Vector Database )**.

{{< /alert >}}

I came across the term **Embedded Database** recently, and I found them quite interesting. So I decided to write a blog post to share what I learned about them.


# What is an Embedded Database?
An **embedded database** is a DBMS that is tightly integrated into an application, running within the same process. Unlike traditional client-server databases, embedded databases do not require a separate server to manage queries and transactions. This makes them highly efficient for applications that need fast, local data storage **without the overhead of network communication**.

## Introduction to RocksDB

One of the most popular embedded databases today is **RocksDB**, an open-source, high-performance key-value store developed by Facebook. RocksDB is based on **LevelDB** but has been optimized for better write performance, lower latency, and high scalability.

### Key Features of RocksDB
- **Log-Structured Merge (LSM) Trees**: RocksDB uses LSM trees to optimize write operations and enable fast data ingestion.
- **Optimized for SSDs**: It takes advantage of modern SSD storage for efficient read/write operations.
- **Configurable Compression**: Supports multiple compression algorithms like Zstandard and Snappy to optimize storage.
- **High Concurrency**: Supports multiple read and write operations simultaneously without performance degradation.
- **Point Lookups and Range Queries**: Allows both individual key-value retrieval and efficient range scans.

### Fault Tolerance in RocksDB

RocksDB is designed to be resilient to failures and provides several features to ensure data durability and recovery:

- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Ensures data integrity by logging changes before they are committed.
- **Snapshots**: Enables point-in-time recovery by capturing the state of the database at a specific moment.
- **Automatic Recovery**: Upon restart, RocksDB can detect inconsistencies and recover data from the WAL.
- **Replication**: RocksDB can be configured for replication to provide higher availability in distributed systems.

### Where is RocksDB Used?

RocksDB is widely used in applications that require high-speed data processing and efficient storage solutions, most of them take RocksDB as a **storage engine**:

- **Real-time streaming**: Integrated into systems like Apache Kafka Streams for state management.
- **Real-time stateful stream processing**: Used in systems like Apache Flink for stateful stream processing.
- **Distributed object storage**: Used in systems like Apache Ozone for metadata storage in distributed object stores.

## Example: Using RocksDB in Python

Letâ€™s look at a simple example of using RocksDB in Python to store and retrieve key-value pairs.

**Note**: <br>
For RocksDB itself, it provides C++ and Java APIs, but for Python, you can use the `rocksdict` package, which provides a Pythonic interface to RocksDB.

### Installation
You can install Python bindings using `uv`:

```sh
uv pip install rocksdict
```

> [RocksDict](https://github.com/rocksdict/RocksDict)

### Sample Code
```python
import rocksdict

# Open a RocksDB database
db = rocksdict.Rdict("./testdb")

# Insert data
db[b"name"] = b"Alice"
db[b"age"] = b"25"

# Retrieve data
print(db[b"name"].decode())  # Output: Alice
print(db[b"age"].decode())   # Output: 25

# Close the database
db.close()
```

## More Operations with RocksDB

RocksDB provides a rich set of operations for managing data efficiently:
- **Snapshotting**: Create a snapshot of the database to capture its state at a specific moment.
- **Batch Writes**: Perform multiple write operations atomically for better performance.
- **Iterators**: Traverse the key-value pairs in the database efficiently.
- **Transactions**: Ensure atomicity and consistency for multiple read and write operations.
- **Column Families**: Organize data into multiple column families for better data management.
- **Statistics**: Monitor the performance of the database using built-in statistics.
- **Observability**: Monitor the database using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for better insights.

> For the above operations, you can refer to the [rocksdb-lab](https://github.com/erhwenkuo/rocksdb-lab/tree/master) for more details with hands-on examples in Java.
