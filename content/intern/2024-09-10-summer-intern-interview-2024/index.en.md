## Introduction

Drawing from online resources and giving back to the online community, this blog shares experiences from software internship interviews in 2024, without revealing company-specific questions or confidential information.  
The goal is to reduce information asymmetry and provide insights into the interview processes and directions of various companies.

## How to Find Software Internship Opportunities?

This year's internship opportunities were found through the following two channels:

### LinkedIn

Around March, companies begin posting internship openings on LinkedIn.  
While they may not post promotions, they will definitely list positions on the "Jobs" section of LinkedIn.  
Simply search with the keyword `Summer Intern` in the jobs tab, and you can casually browse daily.

### Tech Conferences

Conferences like SITCON, COSCUP, and MOPCON are great places, not just for attending talks but also for directly chatting with full-time employees at company booths.  
You can inquire about the actual work, technology focus, and interview process for summer internships.

![SITCON]()

At this year's SITCON, I asked full-time employees at booths from companies like Dcard, Line, and Trend Micro about their summer internships.  
For instance, I learned at the Line booth that they only offer long-term internships that require in-office work, which isn't feasible for me since I still have to attend classes in Tainan.  
> Not sure if Line's policy has changed, but that was the information at the time.

## Motivation

The primary focus was on companies dealing with data-intensive, high-traffic, and low-latency services.  
I wanted to experience the architecture of large-scale distributed systems and the development process of large services, as well as the challenges that arise in such systems.

Below are the companies I interviewed with for summer internships this year:
